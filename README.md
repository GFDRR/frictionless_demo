# Scripts for GOST show-and-tell (March 11, 2021)
This repo contains scripts on:
* overlaying public asset data from OSM with the Global Landslide Hazard Map
* analyzing disaster event with pyEmdat
* bulk download of OSM point of interest data

For the landslide exposure overlay, try running in Binder. The pyEmdat scripts require local download of EMDAT data subject to the appropriate license agreement (see www.github.com/gfdrr/pyEmdat)
