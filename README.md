# Scripts for GOST show-and-tell (March 11, 2021)
This repo contains scripts on:
* overlaying public asset data from OSM with the Global Landslide Hazard Map
* analyzing disaster event with pyEmdat
* bulk download of OSM point of interest data

Hit the 'launch Binder' button below to open these scripts in a live environment. For details of Binder see the [presentation slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HeAcukZ5jbIRBsykWLDLFptZWRPyOWV76yChydZ79Ok/edit?usp=sharing). Try running the landslide exposure notebook in Binder. NB the pyEmdat scripts are best run on your local machine, as EMDAT data requires each user to agree to licence terms ahead of any data download (see www.github.com/gfdrr/pyEmdat)
